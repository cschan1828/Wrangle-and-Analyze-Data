# Project 4 - Wrangle & Analyze Data

## About the Project
The project used data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account. The data was assessed, cleaned and analyzed to provide accurate insights into account follower behaviour.

An online summary of the material can be found at my blog.

The project involved gathering data using a variety of file types and gathering techniques (manual download, programmatic download, api access), assessing the data for quality and tidiness, cleaning the data using a define, code, test methodology, and completing analysis and visualzations of the cleaned datasets.

### Prerequisites

 - Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
 - Anaconda (for reading iPython files efficiently)
 - Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, json, os, requests, tweepy

### Installing

- [Web Browser]([https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))
- For installing the libraries 
	After installing anaconda, run `anaconda command prompt`. By default you will be in the base environment. You can either create your own envoronment or install required libraries in the base.
	Commands: `conda install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tweepy`

### Break down into end to end tests

In the notebook, Go to `Cell` and press `Run All`
If all the code ran without erros, you have done everything correctly.

### And coding style tests

Follow the [documentation]([https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/coding_style.html](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/coding_style.html)) for coding styles required in python notebooks.

## Deployment

The browser running the notebook is the live deployment of the entire code. You can edit it and have fun with it.

#### Anaconda
This is recommended to be installed for managing the iPython files efficiently
When we launch the `jupyter notebook` from the anaconda prompt, we are automacially redirected to the browser where we can find the files.

## Built With

 - [iPython]([https://ipython.org/](https://ipython.org/)) - This is the file conaining all the python codes. We can make separate blocks of iPython for performing separate tasks. File extension is `.ipynb`
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)) - [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. With over 11 million users worldwide, it is the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.
